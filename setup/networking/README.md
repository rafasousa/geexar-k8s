# Raspberry Pi Networking Setup

When you plug a fresh new Raspberry Pi into your network, the default configuration tells the Pi to use DHCP to dynamically request an IP address from your network's router. Typically this is a pretty random address, and it can make configuration annoying.

To keep things simpler, I elected to jot down the MAC addresses of each of the Pis' onboard LAN ports (this stays the same over time), and map those to a set of contiguous static IP addresses so I can deploy, for example, the balancer to 10.0.1.60, the webservers to 10.0.1.61-62, and so on.

The playbook and configuration in this directory will automatically perform all the required networking configuration to make this so.

To run the playbook:

  1. Copy `example.inventory` to `inventory`, and list all your Raspberry Pi's _current_ IP addresses under `[dramble]`
  2. Copy `example.vars.yml` to `vars.yml`, and make sure each Pi's MAC address is mapped to the desired final IP addresses and hostnames.
  3. Run `ansible-playbook -i inventory main.yml`.

> _Note_: If you don't have your SSH key installed on all the Pis yet, you will also need to pass `-k` to the above command and enter your SSH password (the default for Raspbian is `raspberry`).

> To copy to SSH key Pis
> # Create directory if doesn't exists
> ssh pi@10.0.0.18 'mkdir -p .ssh && echo "Directory created"'
> 
> # Copy local id_rsa.pub to Pi 
> cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh pi@<hostname> 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys && echo "Key copied"'
> 
> # Test is everthing okay
> ansible all -i inventory -m shell -a "ping google.com"
> 

Assuming everything went well, the Pis should switch over to their new IP addresses quickly; if they don't, you can forcefully reboot them with the command:

    $ ansible all -i inventory -m shell -a "sleep 1s; shutdown -r now" -b -B 60 -P 0

Now you should be able to run the main Dramble playbooks on your Pi cluster!

## Updating hostnames or IPs

If you ever need to change active Dramble networking info, it's easy! Just change the IP addresses inside the `inventory` file to the active IP addresses of your Pis and run the playbook again, then reboot all your Pis again.

## Manual Networking Setup

_If you don't want to use the automated playbook, you can do the following on each Raspberry Pi individually_:

  1. Set a unique hostname (e.g. `kube1.pidramble.com` for the first server, and `kube2.pidramble.com` for the second server):
    1. Edit `/etc/hostname` and replace the existing hostname with the new hostname.
    2. Enter `hostname [new-hostname]` to update the hostname immediately.
    3. Edit `/etc/hosts` and replace the existing hostname with the new hostname.
  2. Set up the network settings for our Pi network:
    1. TODO - these instructions changed with Rasbpian Stretch.
    2. Restart the Pi: `sudo reboot`
    3. You'll need to reconnect to the Pi on its new static IP address.

The networking configuration may need to be a little different depending on the environment in which you're using your own Dramble (whether it's on an isolated private network, connected to another network/router, using bridged WiFi interfaces, etc.).
